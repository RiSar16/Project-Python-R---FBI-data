# Project-Python-R-FBI-data
This project is made for applying the tools acquired in Multivariate Statistics Analysis. The purpose is to train different classifiers and compare their performance with feature extraction (PCA). 

The script is in Python and R. 

The chemical composition of a glass contributes in the discrimination of glass fragments and therefore in the correct classificaiton of a single fragment within forensic investigations. Classification methods can help to determine if a glass fragment belongs to a window (float) or non-window (non-float). 

I acquire domain knowledge by Maureen C. Bottrell (2009) "Forensic Glass Comparison: Background Information Used in Data Interpretation" to understand better what the dataset is about.
