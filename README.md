# Project-Python-R-FBI-data
This project is made for applying the tools acquired in Multivariate Statistics Analysis 

The script is in Python and R. 

The goal is to train different classifiers and compare their performance with feature extraction (PCA). 

I acquire domain knowledge by Maureen C. Bottrell (2009) "Forensic Glass Comparison: Background Information Used in Data Interpretation" to understand better what the dataset is about. 

The data is downloaded by https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/glass+identification

The task is to predict the right class of the glass fragments
