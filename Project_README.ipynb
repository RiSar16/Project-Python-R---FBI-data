    "Several chemical elements are used to produce glass. Many are the types of glass that can be found in vehicles, utensils, and windows. Despite glass manufacturing being automated and uniform, variations remain due to impurities of the raw materials employed in the production. For this reason, glass products present minor variations. \n",

    "The refractive index is a metric useful for capturing minor variations of a glass product and it is a commonly used metric in forensic investigation for the examination of glass fragments (Koons et al. 2002). \n",

    "Nevertheless, the refractive index might be not enough to distinguish the properties of a non-window glass from window glass. Since the raw materials to produce those types of glass are similar, the refractive index measurement may overlap glass types.\n",
